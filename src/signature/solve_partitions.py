    Compute all possible solutions for a matrix P given constraints.

    This function computes solutions for each row in the matrix `P`, based on the `morgan` values,
    with constraints applied from matrix `C`. The function generates partitions for each row's
    non-zero elements and checks for compatibility with `C`, considering parity constraints and
    already satisfied lines. It limits the number of partitions to avoid excessive computation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P : numpy.ndarray
        The matrix representing the system for which solutions are computed. Rows with non-zero
        elements indicate parts that need to be partitioned according to the corresponding `morgan` value.
    morgan : list of int
        A list of integers representing the values that each row in `P` should sum to when partitions
        are considered.
    C : numpy.ndarray
        The matrix containing constraints that solutions must satisfy.
    parity_indices : list of int
        Indices indicating which rows in `C` correspond to parity constraints.
    partitions_involved_for_C : list of list of int
        A list where each element is a list of indices involved in a specific row of `C`.
    lines_of_C_already_satisfied : set of int
        A set of line indices in `C` that have already been satisfied by previous computations.
    max_nbr_partition : int, optional
        The maximum number of partitions to generate, default is 100,000.
    verbose : bool, optional
        If True, print detailed information about the processing steps. Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        - dict_sols (dict): A dictionary where keys are tuples representing partitions, and values
          are lists of possible solutions for each partition.
        - lines_of_C_already_satisfied (set of int): Updated list of line indices in `C` that are satisfied.
